# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
## Introduction
This repository contains my HTML and CSS coding projects for the Web Design and Software Development Diploma Course.
The repository encapsulates my journey toward creating web pages that provide an optimized user experience in terms of navigation structure, responsiveness, and design in general.
## Technologies
The structure of the web pages will be based on the latest HTML5 standard.
The layout of the web pages will be formatted using the Cascading Style Sheets 3 (CSS3) language.
Interactive content for the web pages will be incorporated using JavaScript at a later stage.
## Projects
This is a display of sample websites that I have made using HTML and CSS.<br>
- [Zambezi River Tours Site](https://github.com/KennethNhunduru/HTML-and-CSS-Projects/tree/main/Zambezi_River_Tours_Project)<br>
- [Movie Theatre Site](https://github.com/KennethNhunduru/HTML-and-CSS-Projects/tree/master/bootstrap4_project])
## Zambezi River Tours Site
This page is an example home page for a Zambezi River holiday tour company.<br> 
Itâ€™s styled using CSS and contains a navbar, image containers, and a form.
## Movie Theater Site
This page is an example home page for a movie theatre that is styled using Bootstrap 4.<br> 
It contains many Bootstrap components including a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdowns among others.
