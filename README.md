# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
## Introduction
This repository contains my HTML and CSS coding projects for the Web Design and Software Development Diploma Course.
The repository encapsulates my journey toward creating web pages that provide an optimised user experience in terms of navigation structure, responsiveness, and design in general.
## Technologies
The structure of the web pages will be based on the latest HTML5 standard.
The layout of the web pages will be formatted using the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) language.
Interactive content for the web pages will be incorporated at a later stage.
## Contact
My mission is to create websites that constantly evolve to keep up with modern design practices and standards and improve the user experience.
All comments and improvement suggestions for the projects are welcome.
I can be contacted on my email knhunduru@hotmail.com for any comments and/or suggestions
