								There is some evidence to suggest that individuals who are highly intelligent may struggle with common sense or practical problem-solving tasks.<br>
								This is often referred to as the "smart but clueless" phenomenon.<br>
								It's important to note that intelligence is a complex trait that can be influenced by many factors, and it is not always indicative of one's ability to navigate everyday life.<br>
								Additionally, the concept of "common sense" is often subjective and can vary depending on cultural, social, and personal experiences.
