			<h1>Expensive Cars to Drive</h1>
            <p>Wouldn't it be nice to be able to afford all the expensive cars that one would wish to drive?</p>

		    <p>A quote from Tim Berners-Lee the inventor of the World Wide Web and director of the World Wide Web Consortium:</p>
    
	            <blockquote cite="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee#Weaving_the_Web_(1999)">
        		The web is more a social creation than a technical one. I designed it for a social effect - to help people work together - and not as a technical toy. The ultimate goal of the Web is to support and improve our weblike existence in the world.
