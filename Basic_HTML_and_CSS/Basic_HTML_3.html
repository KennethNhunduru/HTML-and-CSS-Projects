	        <h1>Grouping HTML elements for Styling</h1>
		    <p>The div tag is an empty container that is used to define a division or a section. 
	           It does not affect the content or layout and is used to group HTML elements to be styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript scripts.
		       It is possible to place any HTML element within a div tag, including another div.
		       Since div is a block-level element, a line break is placed before and after it.
